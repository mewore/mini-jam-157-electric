## TODO

- [x] ğŸ’š MVP idea - top-down tower defense
    - The game takes place inside a maze-like structure
    - The player places battery-nutrients on the ground, luring a wire-slime-mold-creature to grow towards them and
      ingest them, growing further
    - The player must guide the wire to a clock. While powered, it ticks away. When it makes a full circle, the level is
      won. If the enemies eat the wires in the clock, the game is lost.
    - Creatures storm in from the edge of the map, finding their way to their target. They like to chew away at the
      wire.
        - If they eat an unpowered wire, it simply disappears.
        - If they bite the wire while it's powered, they get zapped and die on the spot. This takes away some of the
          collected reserve of electricity.

### MVP

- [x] ğŸ’™ğŸ’œ Simple maze tilemap
- [x] ğŸ’™ğŸ’œ Simple wire tilemap
- [x] ğŸ’™ Energy meter; wire origin point
- [x] ğŸ’™ Clicking on a spot in the maze grows the wire up to it - the growth costs as much energy as the grown tiles
- [x] ğŸ’™ Batteries, providing the wire with energy
- [x] ğŸ’™ Creature origin points
- [x] ğŸ’™ğŸ’œ Creature
- [x] ğŸ’™ Fog of war enveloping everything more than 3 tiles away from the wire, the origin of the creatures and the clock
- [x] ğŸ’™ Each creature walks around randomly, revealing a 1x1 area of the fog of war. They always prefer to explore or,
  if unable to explore, to return to spots closer to the origin.
- [x] ğŸ’™ The wire pieces light up
- [x] ğŸ’™ When creatures encounter the wire, they start gnawing on it. After some time, these parts of the wire are
  destroyed. Disconnected parts of the wire become unusable, but they can be reunited.
- [x] ğŸ’™ğŸ’œ Clock entity
- [x] ğŸ’™ When creatures encounter the clock, they start gnawing on it. If they succeed, the level is lost. The player
  can also lose if a creature eats the wire origin.
- [x] ğŸ’™ When the player runs out of energy, the level is lost - ~~there is a camera shake and the lights of the wire
  shut down one by one~~
- [x] ğŸ’™ Creature gnawing progress.
- [x] ğŸ’™ Hold {Space} to unleash an electric surge attack
- [ ] ğŸ’œ Battery sprite
- [ ] ğŸ’™ If the wire is connected to the clock and the wire has enough power, the clock starts ticking and the power
  starts draining. The only way to stop this is to get disconnected.
- [ ] ğŸ’™ If the clock is active for a total of 10 seconds, the level is won.
